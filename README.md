# Palladium-intergration

Integrate palladium with M-Pesa

When a payment is made through M-Pesa, we generate a receipt for the payment and post it to palladium system.

Palladium responds with success or failure, depending on the response we update the payment as processed(successful posting) to avoid double processing.
